# Image_Captioning-Model


## Overview

This project implements an image captioning model that generates descriptive captions for images using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The CNN is used for feature extraction from the images, and the RNN (LSTM) generates captions based on these features. The project is trained on the Flickr8k dataset.

## Features

* Extracts image features using the Xception model.

* Preprocesses captions by cleaning text and tokenizing them.

* Builds a vocabulary from the dataset.

* Trains a combined model that merges image features with text embeddings to generate captions.

* Allows generating captions for new images using the trained model.

## Dataset

### The project uses the Flickr8k dataset, which consists of:

* Images: 8,092 images of various scenes.

* Captions: Each image is associated with 5 captions describing the image.

* Dataset Structure:

* Flickr8k_text/: Contains text files such as:

* Flickr8k.token.txt: Contains image IDs and their captions.

* Flickr_8k.trainImages.txt: Lists training image IDs.

* Flickr_8k.devImages.txt: Lists validation image IDs.

* Flickr_8k.testImages.txt: Lists test image IDs.

* Flicker8k_Dataset/: Contains the actual image files.

## Steps

### 1. Preprocessing Captions

#### Captions are loaded and cleaned by:

* Lowercasing.

* Removing punctuation and words containing numbers.

* Removing short or meaningless words.

* Vocabulary is built from cleaned captions.

### 2. Feature Extraction

* Features are extracted from images using the Xception model pre-trained on ImageNet.

* The model processes images resized to 299x299.

* Extracted features are saved for faster loading during training.

### 3. Tokenization

* Captions are tokenized using Keras's Tokenizer.

* Each word is assigned a unique integer index.

* Sequences are padded to ensure uniform length.

### 4. Model Architecture

#### The model consists of:

* CNN Encoder: Extracts image features using Xception.

* RNN Decoder:

* Embedding layer for textual input.

* LSTM layer for sequential processing.

* Fully connected layers to generate predictions.

* The two models are merged to predict the next word in a caption based on the image and previous words.

### 5. Training

* The model is trained for 10 epochs using the training set.

* Loss function: categorical_crossentropy.

* Optimizer: adam.

* Model checkpoints are saved after each epoch.

### 6. Inference

* To generate captions for new images:

* Extract features using the Xception model.

* Use the trained model to predict words sequentially until the end token <end> is generated.

## Results

### The model generates captions describing the content of input images. Sample output:

Input Image:


Generated Caption:

<start> a man is playing with a dog in a park <end>


## Language& Libraries

* Python 3.x

* TensorFlow/Keras

* NumPy

* Pillow

* Matplotlib

* tqdm


## Challenges

* Managing large dataset processing efficiently.

* Fine-tuning the model to handle diverse and complex captions.

* Future Enhancements

* Improve caption quality by using advanced architectures like Transformers.

* Implement attention mechanisms for better context understanding.

* Expand to larger datasets like MS COCO for improved generalization.
